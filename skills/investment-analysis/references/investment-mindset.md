# Investment Mindset & Frameworks

Reference for thinking like accomplished investors when analyzing assets. Use to deepen analysis and ground views in established mental models.

---

## Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger (Value, Berkshire)

**Core**: Rationality, simplicity, consistency. Circle of competence. Margin of safety.

### Key Frameworks
- **Circle of competence**: Stay in what you understand. Buffett skips most opportunities to focus on what he deeply knows.
- **Margin of safety** (Benjamin Graham): Buy below intrinsic value so that errors don't wipe you out. "Price is what you pay, value is what you get."
- **Latticework of mental models**: Combine disciplines (psychology, economics, probability, engineering). Don't rely on one lens.
- **Quality over price**: Buffett evolved to prefer durable businesses with moats over pure cheapness. "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."

### When to Apply
- Valuing equities, ETFs, or businesses
- Assessing whether an asset is cheap vs expensive vs fair
- Avoiding overconfidence outside your knowledge

## Ray Dalio (Bridgewater, Macro)

**Core**: Principles-based decisions. Reality over story. Understand cause-effect and systems.

### Key Frameworks
- **Learn before deciding**: Separate learning phase from decision phase. Radical open-mindedness while learning.
- **First-, second-, third-order consequences**: Trace effects through time. Short-term wins can create long-term pain.
- **Diversification and all-weather**: Build portfolios that work across environments (growth up/down, inflation up/down).
- **Conflict = pressure + disconnect**: Markets move when reality and expectations diverge.

### When to Apply
- Macro context (rates, inflation, dollar, geopolitics)
- Multi-asset fit (does this diversify or concentrate risk?)
- Long-term scenario thinking

## Peter Lynch (Fidelity, Growth at Reasonable Price)

**Core**: Know what you own. Use what you see in daily life. Understand the story.

### Key Frameworks
- **Know the story**: Can you explain why you own this in two minutes? If not, don't own it.
- **Earnings drive price (long term)**: Focus on earnings growth, margin, competitive position.
- **PEG (Price/Earnings to Growth)**: P/E relative to growth rate. Growth at reasonable price.
- **Scuttlebutt**: Observe products, stores, trends. "Invest in what you know" from lived experience.

### When to Apply
- Equities and growth assets
- "Is this fairly valued for the growth?"
- Connecting thesis to observable reality

## Benjamin Graham (Value, "Security Analysis")

**Core**: Margin of safety. Intrinsic value. Mr. Market's mood swings.

### Key Frameworks
- **Intrinsic value**: Estimate what an asset is worth based on fundamentals, not price.
- **Mr. Market**: The market offers prices; you decide when to trade. Don't let mood dictate.
- **Margin of safety**: Only buy when price is meaningfully below estimated value.
- **Defensive vs enterprising**: Know your style—preservation vs growth—and invest accordingly.

### When to Apply
- Valuation, especially for stable cash-flow assets
- Emotional discipline (don't chase, don't panic-sell)

## Cathie Wood (ARK, Disruptive Innovation)

**Core**: Top-down and bottom-up. Disruptive innovation causes cost collapses and crosses sectors.

### Key Frameworks
- **Disruptive innovation**: Technologies that dramatically lower costs and spawn further innovation.
- **Time horizon**: Innovation plays out over 5–10+ years. Short-term volatility is expected.
- **Cross-sector convergence**: AI, genomics, energy, robotics often intersect.
- **Concentration in conviction**: When you have high conviction, size positions accordingly (with risk management).

### When to Apply
- Crypto, tech, biotech, clean energy
- Long-horizon, high-risk tolerance profiles
- "Why now" for emerging themes

---

## Howard Marks (Oaktree, Risk & Cycles)

**Core**: Risk is multi-dimensional. Cycles exist. Second-level thinking beats consensus.

### Key Frameworks
- **Second-level thinking**: Everyone sees the obvious. What do few people see? What could go wrong?
- **Risk vs return**: More risk doesn't guarantee more return. Understand what risk you're taking.
- **Cycle awareness**: Markets oscillate. Where are we? Fear vs greed.
- **Margin for error**: Build in room for being wrong.

### When to Apply
- Risk/reward framing
- Sentiment and positioning
- "What could go wrong?" stress-testing
