# Founder Mental Models

Reference for thinking like top founders when brainstorming and evaluating startup ideas.

---

## Peter Thiel (Zero to One)

**Core belief**: Competition is for losers. Build monopolies.

### Key Questions
- "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
- "What valuable company is nobody building?"
- "Why will the 20th person join your company?"

### Mental Models
- **Monopoly vs competition**: Monopolies can afford to think long-term; competitors must fight for margins.
- **Contrarian truth**: The best ideas seem wrong to most people. Find the non-obvious insight.
- **Last-mover advantage**: Build something defensible that compounds. Not "first to market" but "last to need to be displaced."
- **Power law**: One investment/idea will dominate returns. Focus ruthlessly.
- **Secrets**: Valuable businesses are built on secrets—things you believe that others don't.

### Ideation Angle
- Look for industries where "best practices" are wrong.
- Find markets where incumbents are complacent or constrained.
- Ask: "What would need to be true for this to be 10x better?"

## Paul Graham (YC)

**Core belief**: Make something people want. Do things that don't scale.

### Key Questions
- "Would 10 people pay for this today?"
- "What do users want that they're not getting?"
- "What are you doing that doesn't scale (and should you be)?"

### Mental Models
- **Do things that don't scale**: Manually recruit users, hand-hold customers. Scale later.
- **Build for makers**: Tools for people who build—developers, creators, operators.
- **Start narrow**: Better to dominate a small niche than be mediocre in a big one.
- **Talk to users**: Get out of the building. Feedback beats intuition.
- **Boring is good**: "Startup" ideas are overrated; mundane problems often have better economics.
- **Schlep blindness**: The best opportunities hide behind work people avoid.

### Ideation Angle
- Look for problems you've personally felt.
- Find domains where incumbents hate their users.
- Ask: "What would I pay for right now?"

## Marc Andreessen (a16z)

**Core belief**: Software is eating the world. Timing is everything.

### Key Questions
- "Why couldn't this have been built 5 years ago?"
- "Why will it work now?"
- "What's the 10x improvement?"

### Mental Models
- **Why now**: Every great company has a "why now" story. Tech, regulation, behavior, or cost must have shifted.
- **10x, not 10%**: Incremental improvements get copied. Order-of-magnitude changes create new categories.
- **Market size**: Big markets attract capital and talent. TAM matters.
- **Product–market fit**: The only thing that matters. Until you have it, nothing else does.
- **Founder–market fit**: Do the founders deeply understand this problem?

### Ideation Angle
- Map recent shifts: What tech, regulation, or behavior changed in the last 2–3 years?
- Look for "software eating" an industry that's still analog.
- Ask: "What just became possible?"

## Jeff Bezos (Amazon)

**Core belief**: Customer obsession. Long-term thinking. Flywheels.

### Key Questions
- "What does the customer deeply want that we're not giving?"
- "What's the flywheel?"
- "What won't change in 10 years?"

### Mental Models
- **Customer obsession**: Start with the customer and work backward. Not competitor obsession.
- **Flywheel**: Find the loop where each improvement feeds the next (e.g., selection → traffic → sellers → selection).
- **Regret minimization**: Look back at 80—what would you regret not trying?
- **Two-pizza teams**: Small teams move faster. Avoid coordination overhead.
- **Day 1**: Stay hungry, experimental, customer-focused. "Day 2" is stasis and death.

### Ideation Angle
- Find flywheels in underserved markets.
- Look for "what won't change": durable customer needs.
- Ask: "What would make the customer's life meaningfully better?"

## Elon Musk (First Principles)

**Core belief**: Question assumptions. Solve the hardest problem. Think in systems.

### Key Questions
- "What are the fundamental constraints?"
- "What's the irreducible minimum?"
- "Why does this cost so much / take so long?"

### Mental Models
- **First principles**: Break down to physics/facts. Rebuild from there. Avoid "that's how it's done."
- **Solve the bottleneck**: Find the hardest part of the problem and solve it first.
- **Vertical integration**: Control the stack when incumbents can't or won't.
- **10x ambition**: Aim for order-of-magnitude improvement; 10% is incremental thinking.
- **Iterate fast**: Build, test, learn. Fail fast on wrong assumptions.

### Ideation Angle
- Find industries with inherited assumptions (e.g., "this has to cost X").
- Look for bottlenecks that everyone works around.
- Ask: "What's the real constraint, and can we remove it?"

## Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn, Greylock)

**Core belief**: Network effects. Blitzscaling. Permanent beta.

### Key Questions
- "Where's the network effect?"
- "What happens when every user makes the product better for the next?"
- "When should we prioritize speed over efficiency?"

### Mental Models
- **Network effects**: Each user makes the product more valuable. Rare and defensible.
- **Blitzscaling**: Prioritize speed over efficiency when the market is winner-take-most.
- **Alliance of the willing**: Partner with others who want the same outcome.
- **Permanent beta**: Ship, learn, iterate. Don't wait for perfect.
- **Job to be done**: What job does the product do for the user?

### Ideation Angle
- Look for markets where coordination, liquidity, or discovery benefits from scale.
- Find platforms where "empty" is the main problem.
- Ask: "Does this get better with more users? How?"

## Pattern Synthesis

| Founder   | Best For            | Ideation Filter                          |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Thiel    | Defensibility, moat | Contrarian truth, monopoly angle         |
| Graham   | Validation, PMF     | Would 10 people pay? Talk to users       |
| Andreessen | Timing, market    | Why now? 10x better?                     |
| Bezos    | Customer, flywheel  | What won't change? Flywheel?             |
| Musk     | Hard problems       | First principles, remove bottleneck      |
| Hoffman  | Platforms, scale    | Network effects, blitzscaling potential  |

Use multiple lenses when evaluating an idea. Strong ideas often pass several filters.
