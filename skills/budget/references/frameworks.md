# Budget Frameworks

Short reference for common allocation approaches. Use when the user asks for a framework or "how to budget."

## 50/30/20

- **50%** Needs: housing, utilities, insurance, minimum debt, groceries, essential transport, healthcare
- **30%** Wants: dining out, entertainment, subscriptions, hobbies, non-essential shopping
- **20%** Savings and debt payoff: emergency fund, retirement, extra debt payments

**Base:** Monthly net (after-tax) income. Adjust percentages if user has different priorities.

## Zero-Based Budget

- Income − All planned spending and saving = 0
- Every dollar assigned to a category (including "savings" and "buffer")
- Review and plan each period (e.g. monthly)

**Use when:** User wants strict control or "every dollar has a job."

## Envelope / Category Method

- Fixed set of categories (e.g. groceries, transport, fun, savings)
- Cap per category per period
- "Envelope" = limit for that category (can track in spreadsheet or app)

**Use when:** User wants to limit spending by category.

## Savings-First (Pay Yourself First)

- Set savings (and debt payoff) amount first
- Remaining = spending allowance
- Formula: Income − Savings − Debt payoff = Spending

**Use when:** User's main goal is hitting a savings target.

## Needs vs Wants (Rule of Thumb)

- **Needs:** Must have for safety and basic living (shelter, food, utilities, insurance, minimum debt)
- **Wants:** Improve quality of life but not essential
- User can then allocate remainder to wants and extra savings/debt
