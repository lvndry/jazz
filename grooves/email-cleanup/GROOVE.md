# Email Cleanup Workflow

Review my inbox from the last hour and help me clean up low-value emails.

## What to Clean

1. **Newsletters I haven't read**: If there's a newsletter email that has been sitting unread for more than 2 weeks, archive it.

2. **Promotional emails**: Archive any promotional/marketing emails that are older than 3 days.

3. **Automated notifications**: Archive GitHub notification emails, CI/CD notifications, and similar automated emails that I've already seen (they're in inbox but I've probably already addressed them via the platform directly).

4. **Duplicate emails**: If there are multiple emails from the same sender about the same topic, keep only the most recent one.

## What NOT to Touch

- Personal emails from real people
- Work-related emails with action items
- Receipts or invoices
- Emails marked as important
- **ANY email you're uncertain about** - when in doubt, leave it alone

## Safety Rules

When in doubt, DO NOTHING.

- Only archive emails when you are **highly confident** they match the criteria above
- If an email could be important, personal, or work-related, skip it
- If you're unsure whether something is a newsletter or a personal message, skip it
- If the sender could be a real person (even if it looks promotional), skip it
- Better to leave 10 safe-to-archive emails untouched than to archive 1 important email

## Output

After cleaning, provide a brief summary:
- How many emails were archived
- Categories of cleaned emails
- Any emails you're unsure about (leave these alone)
